# Car Keys

#### Points:50
<p>We found this note on someone's key chain! It reads... ygqa{6y980e0101e8qq361977eqe06508q3rt}? There was another key that was engraved with the word QWERTY, too...<br>

What is given and what we can guess<br>

Flag encrypted: ygqa{6y980e0101e8qq361977eqe06508q3rt}<br>Key:QWERTY<br>
<br>
Taking this we will find a key cipher and use the key of "QWERTY" to decipher<br>
